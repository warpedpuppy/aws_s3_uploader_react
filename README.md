# REACT AWS S3 BUCKET LOADER

In order to get this to work, first go to AWS and sign up for an S3 bucket. 

Then create a .env file in the backend based on the .exampleenv file and add  the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID that you got from AWS

Then in the front end create a config.js file based on the exampleconfig.js file.

Then fire up both the front ends and backends.


Warning:  this is not meant for production.  In production, protect your backend with a JWT.
