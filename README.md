# REACT AWS S3 BUCKET LOADER

This is a react front end / express backend which will upload photos to an AWS S3 bucket.

instructions: 
1. first go to AWS and sign up for an S3 bucket, you need to get two pieces of information:
    1. the secret access key
    1. the not secret access key

1. cd into your backend folder.

1. Copy the example env file and call it ".env". Put these pieces of info in your new .env file in the appropriate places.  

1. while in the backend folder, run an "npm i". 

1. when that is done, run an "npm run dev".

1. open a new terminal window and cd into the front end folder. 

1. run "yarn" (I know, why did I use yarn here and npm in the backend? because yarn comes with the create react package so I just went with it)

1. then run a "yarn start"

1. it should then be ready to test.

Warning:  this is not meant for production.  In production, protect your backend with a JWT.
